# VietAI Machine Learning Foundation Class

## Overview
VietAI started building Machine Learning Foundation Class from July 2017. After 9 classes (6 in Saigon and 3 in Hanoi), the materials and assignments are now mature. However, we always try to update the content to adapt to new changes in the field and needs from students (e.g. TensorFlow 2.0, Kaggle Competions, ...)
